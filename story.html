<div id="apDiv3" >However, this peace between humans and Omnic was not meant to last and as such,  as a result of this new technology, robot uprisings began all over the world and the Omnium began to factorise militarise Omnics in an attempt to overthrow humans and such, the Omnic crisis had begun. India’s population had been displaced, Australia had turned into a desolate wasteland, Siberia was destroyed, the Korean peninsula attacked when a giant robot rose from the sea and the Russian people stood alone against the omnics and defeated them. Among all the chaos the UN had established an elite international task force charged with ending the war and restoring world peace. This team comprised of 5 people, Reinhardt of Germany, Torbjorn of Sweden, Ana Amari of Egypt, Jack Morrison and Gabriel Rayez and thus, began the birth of Overwatch.</div>

<div id="apDiv5"><p>After Overwatch had defeated the Omnic, humans and Omnic lived once again in harmony. With the war over, UN needed to establish world peace across the globe. Nubani in West Africa, became the centre of Human and Omnic cooperation, Himalayas, Rebel omnic monks were granted permission to say there along with Zenyatta to show that even the machines, Omnics, have a soul, Australia, fought back against the Omnium, Korea, established the MEKA program and defeated the giant Omnic by drafting in pro gamers, including Starcraft champion, D’va. As more places needed help, Overwatch started to expand and had gathered new member from all across the globe. However, this peace was hard to maintain. Vishar corporation enforced strict laws on the people that they were trying to help, in Russia the long dormant Omnium awoke and battle had erupted, Australia, locals who were displaced from when the Omnium was returned to the Omnics, had formed the Australian Liberation Front, who managed to blow up the Omnium causing a nuclear explosion, turning its survivors into psychotic and extremely violent people who called themselves, junkers and in France, an Overwatch agent was murdered by his wife who was brainwashed by an organization called Talon.</p></div>

<div id="apDiv9"> <p>Needless to say with the peace starting to crumble around the public, people saw Overwatch as the target to put the blame on. They were accused of allegations, negligence, corruption and even abusing human rights and weapons proliferation. The UN once again decided to take action and launched an investigation and eventually dismantled Overwatch by creating the Petras act, outlawing all current Overwatch agents and those former and so, began the end of Overwatch. For a long time Overwatch had been tearing itself from the inside as a feud between Rayze and Morrison raged on. Morrison had been trying to hold together of what was left of Overwatch but, Rayez did not approve of this, driven by his own unknown agenda. Finally a fight broke out between Morrison and Rayze at the Swiss headquarters. During this brawl a huge explosion had happened reportedly killing both heroes in the blast however, no bodies were recovered. This had marked the end for the Overwatch organisation. Overwatch started to collapse without its commander, Morrison and was eventually finally disbanded. Everyone had gone their own ways, some became mercenaries whilst others were still fighting for the good side.

<div id="apDiv11"> <p>On Watchpoint: Gibraltar, a remote, former Overwatch base, resides and ex-Overwatch agent named Winston. With all the chaos back from all the criminal organisations and crime from all over the world, Winston was fed up with all the disorder that had been caused. Immediately, the base is under attack by the infamous criminal organization called Talon. Just as Winston makes his escape, he then recalls all former Overwatch agents back to active duty and Overwatch is back in action!

    <p>Introduction</p>
    <p>&nbsp; </p>
    <p>On planet Earth, 30 years from now, new technologies were established. This had lead to the birth of the Omnic. Robots utilizing a form of artificial intelligence which, according to some, gives them a ‘soul’. In the early days of this technology, there was peace between these sentient beings called Omnics and the humans who had made them. Robots and Humans were living with one another. </p>
